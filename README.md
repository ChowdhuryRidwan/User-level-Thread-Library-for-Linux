# User-level-Thread-Library-for-Linux
I used Context Switching method to create my library since this method gives the creator full control of scheduling (Round-Robin algorithm) the threads. This project was done out of curiosity during my leisure time. Completing this project has given me great satisfaction and an undeniable desire to create more projects in the future.
